I'm a chemical process engineer working in the food-industry. Although a long time ago I learned to use Basic, Pascal and C++, I decided to shift to python.
With hulp from the internet, by collaboration and the usage of ChatGPT, I have improved my skilles within several months.
Currently I didn't use GitHub, but that is a learning too ;-)
I'm on twitter/X as well @deheij and do have several blogs including the English version of my personal blog Food4Innovations: https://wouterdeheij.com
